üå≥ Growing Tree Animation
Project Overview
This project showcases a dynamic animation of a tree growing using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript with the Canvas API. The animation features a tree that grows branches and fruit over time, decaying after reaching maturity. The process loops, creating a visually engaging experience.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML: Used to structure the webpage and define the canvas element for drawing the tree.
CSS: Styles the canvas and the overall layout, adapting to both light and dark themes.
JavaScript: Handles the animation logic for growing and decaying the tree using the Canvas API.
Canvas API: For drawing and animating the tree and its components.
RequestAnimationFrame: Ensures smooth animations by syncing with the display refresh rate.
Utils: A helper class containing utility functions for calculations and random number generation.
üé® Features
Tree Growth: The animation starts with a trunk that gradually grows into a full tree with branches and fruit.
Dynamic Branching: Each branch can grow further branches, limited by a maximum generation of 10.
Fruit Animation: Once fully grown, the tree produces fruit that falls off and decays over time.
Decay and Regrowth: After fruit drops, the branches decay, and the tree begins to grow again, creating a continuous cycle.
Dark Mode Support: Automatically adjusts colors based on the user's system theme (light/dark mode).
Interactive Canvas: Accessible features, including aria-label for screen readers, enhancing usability.
üéØ Future Improvements
Enhanced Graphics: Introduce more details like leaves and flowers to the tree.
User Interaction: Implement controls for starting/stopping the growth animation or changing the speed.
Responsiveness: Make the canvas and tree responsive to various screen sizes and orientations.
